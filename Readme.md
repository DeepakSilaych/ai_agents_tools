## File/Folder Details

### nodes/

This folder contains all tools and nodes.

### data/

Used to store raw data files or processed datasets required by the application or agents.

### edges/

This folder manages interactions between agents, allowing for modular connections and defining agent-to-agent communication logic.

### env/

Contains environment-specific configuration files, such as `.env` files, that define sensitive information like API keys or database URLs.

### .git

Git directory for version control.

### .gitignore

Lists files and directories to be ignored by Git, such as logs, environment files, and build artifacts.

### llm/

Houses configurations, prompt templates, and utilities related to large language models (LLMs). This includes code for LLM initialization and prompt engineering.

### logs/

Stores application logs, including error logs, debug logs, and execution traces.

### main.py

The main entry point of the application. This script initializes the app, sets up workflows, and runs the primary logic.

### Readme.md

This documentation file provides an overview of the project, its structure, and usage instructions.

### requirements.txt

Lists all Python dependencies required for the project, including libraries like `langchain`, `openai`, and `numpy`. Install these using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### settings.py

Contains application-wide configurations, including constants and environment-specific settings such as:

- API keys
- Vector store configurations
- Workflow parameters

### state.py

Manages and persists application state, such as:

- Agent states
- Workflow progress
- Vector store references

### utils.py

Includes helper functions and utilities that support the main functionality, such as:

- Data preprocessing
- Common utility methods for workflows and agents

### vectorstore.py

Implements the logic for setting up and querying vector stores, used for similarity searches and LLM-powered context retrieval.

### workflows/

Defines workflows as modular components. Each workflow is represented as a YAML/JSON file or Python script. These workflows specify sequences of actions and tool invocations.

## How to Run the Application

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**:
   Place your `.env` file in the `env/` directory with required keys like API keys.

3. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Logs and Debugging

- Logs are stored in the `logs/` folder. Check the logs for error messages or debugging information.
